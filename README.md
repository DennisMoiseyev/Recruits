# The Recruits

For the subjective storylets theme, I chose to play on themes of good and evil. I was closely following the COLA protests on campus and it has been the only thing on my mind lately. I was deeply affected and disturbed by the police violence carried out on undergraduate and graduate protesters. The arrests and what led up to them was very upsetting. I couldn't even work on this project because of the situation. I decided to channel these conflicting feelings into my subjective story. Rather than create a story focusing on the evil police brutality, I decided to create a meta narrative that questions what is good and evil. 

In this story, you wake up strangely at the base of campus. It's unknown how you ended up there. The protesters and police are about to clash just as you and other students regain consciousness. Your options are either to join the protest or head back to campus. The endings for each pathway are similar but one of the areas of exploration presents a very sinister key plot point that helps understand the overall narrative. The protest in the story is what you believe to be a good, just cause to fight for, but there are elements in the storythat suggest the methods of obtaining this goal are evil and unethical.

(I used a [sorting hat approach](https://emshort.blog/2019/11/29/storylets-you-want-them/), providing two distinct pathways that lead to other pathways.)

### Disclaimer!
This story in no way expresses my views on the COLA situation and the graduate student's fight for a cost of living adjustment. This is not intended to portray graduatestudents in a negative way. Stephen King is a huge influence on me (and always will be) and one of his recent books,*The Institute*, put me in the dark mindset to write a story that bends good/evil on the UCSC protests. I was writing this with the mindset of Stephen King. This is entirely fictional and is set in an alternate universe, completely separate from the one we live in now. Just know, I fully support the efforts of graduate students. I just thought this would make an absurdly meta subjective story for this particular project. 


## Acknowledgments
As with my previous project, I would like to thank my T.A. Henry for the help he provided in creating the code to making the choices appear from the javascript file onto the page, and Adam for providing the outline for the algorithm to check the conditions of any conflicts and requirements in my storylets in the assignment slides (Slide 15). That aided me tremendously when I was to write out the function. Also, the helpful guides of javascript methods like to [check if something is an array](https://canvas.ucsc.edu/courses/28774/discussion_topics/128436) was equally helpful in authoring my code.
